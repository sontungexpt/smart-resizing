## Usage

Because this plugin is just contain a builtin function, you need to map it to a keybinding.
like this:

```lua
    -- recommended to use this function since it has a speed up behavior when you hold the keybinding
    -- You should map the keybinding with the modifier key + h/j/k/l

    map("n", "<A-h>", function() require("smart-resizing").adjust_current_win_width(1, 1) end)
    map("n", "<A-l>", function() require("smart-resizing").adjust_current_win_width(1, 2) end)
    map("n", "<A-j>", function() require("smart-resizing").adjust_current_win_height(1, 1) end)
    map("n", "<A-k>", function() require("smart-resizing").adjust_current_win_height(1, 2) end)
```

## Built-in function

- `adjust_current_win_height(step, action)`: adjust the height of the current window (speed up behavior when you hold the keybinding)

  - `adjust_current_win_height(1, 1)`: decrease the height of the current window by 1
  - `adjust_current_win_height(1, 2)`: increase the height of the current window by 1

- `increase_current_win_size(step, dimension)`: increase the size of the current window

  - `increase_current_win_size(1, 1)`: increase the height of the current window by 1
  - `increase_current_win_size(1, 2)`: increase the width of the current window by 1

- `decrease_current_win_size(step, dimension)`: decrease the size of the current window

  - `decrease_current_win_size(1, 1)`: decrease the height of the current window by 1
  - `decrease_current_win_size(1, 2)`: decrease the width of the current window by 1

- `increase_current_win_width(step)`: increase the width of the current window by 1

- `decrease_current_win_width(step)`: decrease the width of the current window by 1

- `increase_current_win_height(step)`: increase the height of the current window by 1
